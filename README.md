# aviorstudio-web

Static website built with Astro.

Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) and run `mise install`, then run:

```sh
mise run dev                 # Development server
mise run check               # Complete applicable source, build and output checks
mise run build           # Generate dist/
mise tasks ls            # Inspect tools and available commands
```

Ctrl-C stops development. This website needs no runtime credentials or credential `.env` file.

For contributor verification, prepare the pinned helper source before running native tasks:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nicodes/tools.git .ci-tools
git -C .ci-tools checkout --detach 091101094fedf5ce2e67c339c1c9c842d6a662dc
mise install
mise run check
```

Build commands record source and exact regular output hashes. Declared tests produce evidence from the current verification session in `.artifacts/verification`.

`mise run dev` owns the checkout’s foreground process tree. Dependency preparation and the application use an isolated local environment through the pinned optional ghenv CLI; no account is needed. Startup refuses changes to the native task policy during preparation. `mise run stop` stops only that checkout, and `mise run clean` refuses cleanup while its session is active.
